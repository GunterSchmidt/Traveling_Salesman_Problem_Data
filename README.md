# Traveling_Salesman_Problem_Data
Repository for Traveling Salesman Problems (mostly Euklydian 2D) with their solutions.

This is a repository for a very large number of TSP-Problems. Each package contains 5,000 TSPs.

It may be suitable for people trying out algorithms on TSPs and comparing to the optimal solution.

All TSPs are brute-force calculated with double number precision. As such, the solutions are expected to be correct.

Because of this and the obvious limitations on brute-force algorithms, the size of the TSP is usually 15 or 16 vertices. Some are bigger.
